# HuntR

![Ui](docs/images/Ui.png)

## User interface

The UI mockup presents HuntR as a workforce management dashboard. The navigation bar on the left gives users quick access to the Overview, Employees, Teams, and Relationships pages. On the Overview page, summary cards show the total numbers of employees, departments, and follow-ups. Users can search for employees and scan key information such as employee ID, department, role, and reporting manager in the central table.

Selecting an employee displays their profile and reporting relationships in the panel on the right, including their manager, teammates, and direct reports. Users can also add, list, find, or edit employees through the command bar at the bottom; for example, they can type `find Maya Chen` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. This combination of visual navigation and keyboard commands helps users understand their workforce at a glance while completing common tasks efficiently.

* This is **a sample project for Software Engineering (SE) students**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * as a starting point of a course project (as opposed to writing everything from scratch)
  * as a case study
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _AddressBook_) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in an object-oriented programming (OOP) style** and provides a **reasonably well-written** codebase of about 6 KLoC. It is **larger** than what students typically write in beginner-level software-engineering modules, without being overwhelming.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `AddressBook Level 3` (`AB3` for short) because it was initially created as a part of a series of `AddressBook` projects (`Level 1`, `Level 2`, `Level 3` ...).
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[HuntR Product Website](https://ay2627-cs2103t-w10-4.github.io/tp/)**.

## Features

### Add employees

HuntR allows HR administrators to add employees to their workforce records using the `add` command. Each employee is assigned a unique employee ID and can have their name, phone number, email, department, and role recorded.

Example:
`add id/E0123 n/John Tan p/91234567 e/johntan@example.com d/Engineering r/Software Engineer`

### List employees

HuntR allows HR administrators to view all employees currently stored in the application using the `list` command. Each employee is displayed with their employee ID, name, phone number, email, department, and role.

Example:
`list`

### Delete employees

HuntR allows HR administrators to remove an employee from the workforce records using the employee's unique employee ID.

Example:
`delete id/E0123`

This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
